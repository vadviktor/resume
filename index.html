      <p>
        As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer, I specialize in backend web technologies, crafting innovative tools that
        streamline daily tasks and enhance developer productivity. My relentless pursuit of problem-solving doesn't
        cease until the root cause is uncovered and addressed. With a polyglot approach to development, I match each
        project with its ideal technology, ensuring optimal outcomes. Beyond coding, I'm passionate about
        knowledge-sharing, frequently engaging with my peers and the broader engineering community through talks at
        local Meetup groups.
