    <p>
      As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer, I specialize in backend web technologies, crafting innovative tools that
      streamline daily tasks and enhance developer productivity. My relentless pursuit of problem-solving doesn't cease
      until the root cause is uncovered and addressed. With a polyglot approach to development, I match each project
      with its ideal technology, ensuring optimal outcomes. Beyond coding, I'm passionate about knowledge-sharing,
      frequently engaging with my peers and the broader engineering community through talks at local Meetup groups.
